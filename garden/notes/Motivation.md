title: "Motivation"

I've been using [Obsidian](Obsidian) a lot, and reading a lot of [digital garden](garden/digital%20garden.md)s from people. There's a motivation to publish a subset of that in an easy to manage way.

I guess also I just like futzing about to a certain extent. It's nice to just play around with something, make notes, things of this nature.
