Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. So plan for it.

- I'm meant to be going on holiday with partner's family, like - the week before the marathon. That's definitely a potential problem.
- Injury, either the back thing or overtraining
	- Mitigation: prioritise rest, prioritise the marathon
	- Mitigation: stretch every day
	- Mitigation: Yoga and easy cross-training
