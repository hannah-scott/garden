## Benefits

1. It's fast
	- Three columns, clear delineation, <5 minutes realistically
2. It's flexible
	- [What is a "plus" to me?](Values)
3. It's future-focused
	- Like a third of the journal is devoted to what's coming up, and it can be informed by the minuses
	- The abstract use of "minus" vs. "what didn't work" could make me less likely to get down on myself about them
