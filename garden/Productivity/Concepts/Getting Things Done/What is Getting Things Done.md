title: "What is Getting Things Done"
---

From https://hamberg.no/gtd/

- a framework created by David Allen
- aim is to make me have 100% trust in my system for collecting tasks, ideas and projects --- everything!
- one assumption is, my subconsciousness is dumb - it doesn't remember what I need to do, just that I need to do something
- so the idea is to convert tasks into tangible actions that I can see

There are 5 lists

1. [The 'in' list](garden/Productivity/Concepts/Getting%20Things%20Done/The%20'in'%20list.md)
2. [The 'next actions' list](garden/Productivity/Concepts/Getting%20Things%20Done/The%20'next%20actions'%20list.md) (there can be several of these)
3. [The 'waiting for' list](garden/Productivity/Concepts/Getting%20Things%20Done/The%20'waiting%20for'%20list.md)
4. [Projects](garden/Productivity/Concepts/Getting%20Things%20Done/Projects.md)
5. Someday/maybe

There is also a calendar that lets me write down date- and time-sensitive tasks/events.
