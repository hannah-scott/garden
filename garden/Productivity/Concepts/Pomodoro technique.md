title: "Pomodoro technique"
---

A time management technique.

Strategies I've used that haven't really worked have been:

- use them by default for everything
- use them periodically for nothing
- other badly defined things

I get that they work --- but I have a lot of meetings, and my work doesn't always fit nicely into 25 minute chunks. So possibly not for me.

I prefer to do a trick I learnt from [ADHD](ADHD) research:

1. Set a timer for 10 minutes (shorter time, better time)
2. Work broadly on the task until the timer goes off
3. At the end, ask yourself if you want to continue

This has advantages, e.g. regular check-ins make sure you don't burn yourself out as hard.
