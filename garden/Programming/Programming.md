Programming is telling a computer what to do.

## Languages

I can program in:

- [Golang](garden/Programming/Languages/Golang.md) pretty well
- [Python](Programming/Languages/Python.md) fucking excellently (joke)
- [Javascript](garden/Programming/Languages/Javascript.md) kind of
- [Lisp](garden/Programming/Languages/Lisp.md) a tiny bit
	- mostly [Scheme](Scheme)
- [C](Programming/Languages/C.md), but not really
	- although I did build [`cite`](garden/Programming/cite.md) in C so who knows?
- [Forth](garden/Programming/Languages/Forth.md) a tiny bit
