#code #golang #go

It's a programming language!

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hi !")
}
```

## What's it good for?

- Concurrency, although I never use it
- Making little CLI tools

## What's it bad at?

- There's no native GUI package, so GUI stuff is weird
