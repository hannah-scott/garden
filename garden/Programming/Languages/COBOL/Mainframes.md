[*What are Mainframes?* video](https://invidious.lunar.icu/embed/ximv-PwAKnc)

Mainframe computers. Big ol' machines living in large cabinets. **Not** a supercomputer, defined differently.

Supercomputers = great at number crunching
Mainframes = great at throughput and reliability

Lots of I/O connectivity. Often deployed in places that require processing lots of small transactions quickly.

For example, IBM mainframes are used in banks to process card transactions.

They use big custom CPUs, and *SAPs* - which exist just to move data around very quickly. Each I/O card might also have its own processing cores, potentially a shit ton of processors.

All of this is designed for reliability and redundancy. They can be deployed in places where no amount of downtime is acceptable, at all.

Very common for mainframes to be built in a way that allows swapping of drawers. Whatever gets pulled, gets moved somewhere else. Redundancy.
