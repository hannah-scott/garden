title: "Quartz"

[Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) is a free open-source alternative to Obsidian's Publish framework. It's based on [Hugo](Hugo) and seems pretty good.

I picked it because while there are lots of Javascript components that allow additional functionality (the graph!), the majority of the site will function without JS.
