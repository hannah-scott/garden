<h1 class="title">Calling Bullshit</h1>
</header>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I’m reading this for my book club with my friend. ## Chapter
summaries</p>
<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>I agree with their opinion that people fall for things that make them
feel smart, what they call “second-order bullshit”. People like feeling
like the insider.</p>
<p><strong>Harry Frankfurt:</strong> bullshit is a defining
characteristic of our time.</p>
<p>They draw a distinction between “old-school” and “new-school”
bullshit. By old-school, they mean “rhetoric or fancy language”. By
new-school, they mean data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New-school bullshit uses the language of math and science and
statistics to create the impression of rigor and accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So something like this:</p>
<p>[[Books/Attachments/The Bullshit Line.png]]</p>
<p>I disagree with the above dichotomy, because [[Fuck binaries]] and
because there is too much overlap between the two modes. A less rigid
model might look like this:</p>
<p>[[Books/Attachments/The Bullshit Triangle.png]]</p>
<p>This also happens to map to the [[Trivium]] because I’m smart.</p>
<p>A lot of their problems with data bullshit are problems of
<strong>specificity</strong>, by which I mean “people not telling you
everything right away immediately”. As someone with [[ADHD]] I can
appreciate that: we all get bored, don’t we?</p>
<p>The examples they give aren’t great. This is because they are
<strong>extracts</strong>. It’s very easy to take a piece of writing out
of context and make it seem deceptive: <strong>you are removing the
context</strong>. The context might be necessary. For example, they cite
what appears to be an extract from an oncological paper that makes some
claims that they call “bullshit” on. But this writing isn’t prima facie
bullshit: it might just be technical. There is a difference between
assumed knowledge on the part of the reader, and bullshit. Not
everything needs to be [[ELI5]].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of us don’t feel qualified to challenge information that is
presented in quantitative form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with this. They also argue that often only basic logical
reasoning is required to see through data bullshit: I agree with this
too.</p>
<p>Then they get into politics, and that’s where it all falls down of
course. They argue that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>adequate bullshit detection is essential for the survival of liberal
democracy. Democracy has always relied on a critically thinking
electorate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fundamentally disagree with at least half of this. Democracy <em>in
no way</em> requires a critically thinking electorate. I would be
interested to know their definition of “democracy”, and possibly also
their definition of “relied on”. Arguably a foundational quality of
liberal democracy is the fact that the citizen is not obligated to think
critically, in any way. A bit “we shouldn’t let stupid people vote” if I
choose to be unfair.</p>
<p>They also cite Mark Galeotti, who said in a <em>New York Times</em>
op-ed that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the United States government should teach the public to tell when
they are being manipulated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that it is not in the US government’s best interests to
do is, if it wants to continue as a going concern. Once manipulation is
adequately defined, a lot of people see government intervention as a
form of manipulation. They have a monopoly on violence, after all.</p>
<p>The authors also believe that bullshit can be challenged apolitically
- I would challenge their definition of “apolitical”. The authors state
that voters seeing through bullshit adds to the health of a democracy,
which I do agree with in principle but which contradicts their claim of
apoliticality. Who defines bullshit, and why? If bullshit detection is
critical for the functioning of democracy, then <em>these are political
questions</em>.</p>
<p>The purpose of education is to “improve bullshit detection”, amongst
other things. They argue that STEM has been prioritised over critical
thinking: then why aren’t people comfortable arguing statistics? Hannah
is an outlier and shouldn’t be counted, but most STEM-lords are happy
arguing statistics all day long. I disagree with their assessment that
“in STEM fields, students seldom are given paradoxes that they need to
resolve, conflicting forms of evidence that they must reconcile,” and so
forth. Mathematics (the M part) both contains volumes of paradox,
exceptions, false friends, and requires precise logical reasoning.
Similarly with the sciences. I don’t think the issue is that STEM
students lack critical thinking: rather, I think the authors have
<strong>over</strong>emphasised the degree to which <em>anyone</em> has
critical thinking skills, in any way.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<p>They want to answer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is bullshit?</li>
<li>Where does bullshit come from?</li>
<li>Why is so much of it produced?</li>
</ol>
<p>So I’ll be evaluating this chapter based on how well those questions
get answered.</p>
<p>They compare bullshitting to sophistry, being “indifferent to what is
actually true and interested only in winning arguments”.</p>
<p>This is an interesting historical note, and worthy of study: you
might ask <em>why</em> some people are interested in winning arguments.
Do they have some alterior motive? Do they seek a <em>higher</em> truth,
or maybe not value truth as highly as other people? Is bullshit simply
the manifestation of a clash of value systems?</p>
<p>Instead they talk about shrimp: mantis shrimp in particular, and how
they sometimes pretend to still have dangerous punching power even
whilst molting. But they don’t <em>directly</em> argue that this is why
people spout bullshit. <strong>One could argue</strong> that the authors
are “using the language of science to create the impression of rigor and
accuracy,” <strong>couldn’t one?</strong></p>
<p>They also somewhat arbitrarily assert that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this behaviour isn’t something that these creatures think up and
decide to carry out. It is merely an evolved response, a sort of
instinct or reflex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why they state this, without evidence, I have no idea. I don’t think
it’s wrong: it’s just interesting.</p>
<p>They talk about <strong>theory of mind</strong>, and bring up that
ravens have a theory of mind. That’s kind of neat. But yeah. Ravens can
fake out other ravens while making a food cache, and can trick them into
not being able to find the hidden food. That’s pretty cool.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong> is tremendously expressive, in that we can
convey a broad range of ideas. This, they claim, is one of the
contributing factors to bullshit proliferation. We can say lots of
different things, some of which are false, and have the theory of mind
to <strong>predict what impact they will have on other
people</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By paying attention to communication, you are giving other people a
“handle” they can use to manipulate your behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They draw the distinction between bullshitters who are trying to
actively deceive, and those who are indifferent to the truth. Which is
interesting, and I wish they’d done that before all the chat about
shrimp and ravens. That was kind of a waste of time, now, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>Even supposedly other-regarding signals carry information about the
self. When you tell a story about someone else, you’re highlighting
e.g. that you thought the story was of interest. This is technically
true, but not interesting, and I don’t think it’s actually doing
anything here.</p>
<p>They argue that <strong>vanity generates “a lot” of
bullshit</strong>. How much? The majority?</p>
<p>They then go on to talk about Brandolini’s principle, which is this
idea from 2014(!) that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of
magnitude bigger than to produce it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spurious use of “an order of magnitude” there. Is Brandolini “using
the language of math to create the impression of rigor and accuracy”?
<strong>Who could possibly say?!</strong></p>
<p>They then go on to talk about Andrew Wakefield for a bit, and the
fact that all of his claims have been widely discredited while people
continue to spread bullshit about vaccines. But why did Andrew Wakefield
spread the false claim that “vaccines cause autism” in the first
place?</p>
<p>The answer is: he didn’t. He claimed specifically that the
“triple-shot” MMR vaccine caused autism. And the reason that he did this
is that he had a business selling single-shot MMR vaccines. He stood to
make <strong>money</strong> off of his claim. It wasn’t that Andrew
Wakefield “simply didn’t care about the truth”. The reality is, he cared
<em>less</em> about the truth than about <strong>making money</strong>.
He was motivated - quite simply - by greed. See for example Hbomberguy’s
video on the subject. This is relegated to a footnote, but it is a
<strong>major driver</strong> of Wakefield’s bullshit.</p>
<p>Let’s assess the chapter, in light of those three questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is bullshit?
<ul>
<li>This is adequately explained, I think. It’s just a term: the
definition can be loose enough.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where does bullshit come from?
<ul>
<li>Under-explored: shrimp, maybe?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Why is so much of it produced?
<ul>
<li>That depends on your definition of what “why” is.</li>
<li>“Why” is so much bullshit produced? Because it’s harder to get rid
of than it is to produce it? No - that only explains why there’s so much
of it, <strong>not</strong> why it was produced in the first place.</li>
<li>The failure of this book to highlight power and financial motivators
in its first two chapters is pretty shocking. Bullshit is
<em>fundamentally</em> political, but they’ve decided to study it
through an apolitical lens. They’re not allowing themselves to see the
financial motivators. It’s a shame. #### Definitions</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>paltering</strong> - misleading rather than directly lying
<ul>
<li>gives the liar a level of plausible deniability</li>
<li>only possible because of how we use language
<ul>
<li><strong>pragmatics</strong> - implied meaning</li>
<li><strong>implicature</strong> - what a sentence is used to mean, not
necessarily what it <em>literally</em> means</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>weasel wording</strong> - using the gap between literal
meaning and implicature to avoid responsibility
<ul>
<li>they mention advertising and politics
<ul>
<li>“reduce plaque by <strong>up to</strong> 50%”</li>
<li>“<strong>people are saying</strong>”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>self-regarding signal</strong> - a signal that refers to the
signaller itself
<ul>
<li>e.g. “I’m sexy”, “I’m poisonous”</li>
<li>they claim this is how animals typically communicate</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>other-regarding signal</strong> - a signal that refers to
some other signified
<ul>
<li>they claim these are uncommon among animal signals, except in cases
of alarm
<ul>
<li>counterpoint: bees, ants, ravens, dogs</li>
<li>why are they claiming these things?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>they argue human vocabulary is necessary for talking about things
other than ourselves
<ul>
<li>I don’t think this is necessarily true or adequately argued</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
